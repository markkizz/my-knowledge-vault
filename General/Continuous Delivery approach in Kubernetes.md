1.  GitOps: GitOps is an approach to continuous delivery that uses Git repositories to manage and deploy applications in a Kubernetes environment. In this approach, the desired state of the application is defined in a declarative configuration file and stored in a Git repository. Changes to the application are made by committing changes to this configuration file, and the deployment is automatically updated to reflect the changes. This approach allows teams to easily manage and version their applications and deployments, and it enables them to quickly and safely deploy changes to their applications.
2. Trunk-based development: Trunk-based development is a software development practice that involves committing code changes directly to the main branch of the codebase (the "trunk"). In a continuous delivery pipeline using this approach, code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production as soon as they are committed to the trunk. This approach allows teams to make changes to their code quickly and easily, and it enables them to deploy changes to production frequently and reliably.
3. Feature branching: Feature branching is a software development practice that involves creating a separate branch for each new feature that is being developed. In a continuous delivery pipeline using this approach, code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production as soon as they are committed to the feature branch. This approach allows teams to work on multiple features simultaneously and to easily manage and deploy changes to their codebase.
4.  Canary deployment: Canary deployment is a technique for gradually rolling out new versions of an application to a subset of users, before deploying the changes to the entire user base. In a continuous delivery pipeline using this approach, code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to a small number of users, and the deployment is monitored for any issues. If the deployment is successful, the changes can be gradually rolled out to more users, and eventually to the entire user base. This approach allows teams to safely test and deploy changes to their applications without affecting all users at once.
5. Blue/green deployment: Blue/green deployment is a technique for deploying new versions of an application by maintaining two separate environments (a "blue" environment and a "green" environment) and switching traffic between them. In a continuous delivery pipeline using this approach, code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to the "green" environment, and traffic is routed to the "green" environment once the deployment is successful. This approach allows teams to easily roll back to the previous version of the application if there are any issues with the new deployment.
6. Progressive delivery: Progressive delivery is an approach to continuous delivery that involves gradually rolling out new features to users over time, rather than deploying them all at once. In a continuous delivery pipeline using this approach, code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to a subset of users, and the deployment is monitored for any issues. If the deployment is successful, the changes can be gradually rolled out to more users, allowing teams to safely and incrementally introduce new features to their applications.
